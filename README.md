# MMA Klub PRINCIP - HTML/CSS/JS Website  

:martial_arts_uniform: This is a static website built as a demo for a friend's **MMA club**, created using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery**. The project served as both a real-world example and a way to reinforce fundamental web development concepts.  

## Purpose  
:boxing_glove: This project was primarily developed to solidify my understanding of **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery**, while also delivering a functional and visually appealing website for the MMA club.  

ðŸš€ *Future improvements may include backend integration for contact forms and dynamic content management.*
